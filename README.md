# ProceduralPacman
Since the beginning of Video Games, procedural generation has been used by developers to make their games more random, realistic and light weighted. When your game relies on algorithms to create stuff, minor tweaking in the parameters can cause huge changes. The game 'No Man's Sky' is an excellent example of using this technique. Here is the youtube link to the animals that this game generated. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=059vo1uGjLQ. I was inspired to make something procedurally and hence here is my attempt on it. This game has a pacman like gameplay, there are AIs in the game, that move in grids. The player dies when it touches the AI. The specialty of this game is that each new level one plays is procedural generated. The Movement of AIs, the number of coins, the number of AIs, their placement etc changes with slight parameter changes. This is just a small attempt at procedural generation. I would love to collaborate with anyone trying to make something procedural! Let me know how you feel about this!
